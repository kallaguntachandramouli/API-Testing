API (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge that allows two software applications to communicate with each other.
   It defines how one system can request data from another and how the other should respond.
How API works:
  1. Your app sends a request to the API.
  2. API goes to the server and fetches the data.
  3. Server sends a response back.
Example:
   ==>You build a mobile app that shows today’s weather for Chennai.
How it works using an API:
1. Your app sends a request like:
==>GET https://api.weather.com/today?city=Chennai
2. API receives the request and asks the weather server for data.
3. Server returns info like:
{
  "city": "Chennai",
  "temperature": "18°C",
  "condition": "rain"
}
4. Your app displays the weather.
Summary:
Your app never stores weather data — it fetches it from the API.
