==>PUT → Update or Create a resource at a specific URL

Idempotent: Sending the same PUT request multiple times results in the same outcome.

Client decides the resource location (URL).

Commonly used to update an existing resource.

Can also create a resource if it doesn’t exist, but only at the specified URL.

Example: Update a user’s profile
PUT /users/123
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "Abhi",
  "age": 24
}
Meaning:
"Store this user at /users/123

==>POST → Create a resource under a collection

Not idempotent: Calling POST multiple times creates additional resources.

Server decides the location (URL) of the new resource.

Used for creating resources or performing actions that do not fit CRUD neatly.

Example: Create a new user
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "Abhi",
  "age": 24
}
Server response:
201 Created
Location: /users/456
